/*
Type-aware rules can be tested in almost exactly the same way, except you need to create some files on disk. 
We require files on disk due to a limitation with TypeScript in that it requires physical files on disk to initialize the project.
See documentation : https://typescript-eslint.io/packages/rule-tester/#type-aware-testing
